// The while loop repeats through a block of code, but only as long as a specified condition is true.

// Note = The condition can be any conditional statement that returns true or false.

// Here's the syntax

while (condition) {
    code block
}

// The loop in this code will continue to run as long as i is less than, or equal to, 10. And each time the loop runs, it will increase by 1.

// This will output the values from 0 to 10.
var i = 0;
while (i <= 10) {
    document.write(i + "<br />");
    i++;
}

// Fill in the blanks to print x's values from 1 to 5.
var x = 1;
while (x <= 5) {
    document.write(x + "<br />");
    x = x + 1;
}

// Make sure that the condition in a while loop eventually becomes false.
